1. Newes coming up out of the NORTH, sounding towards the South.

    _ A word from the Lord to all you yet in your first birth, slaying and persecuting the righteous, whose ways are righteous, and accepted of God. Therefore now repent and turn to the Lord: For now is he coming to render vengeance upon all who know him not, and all who disobey the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is now preached forth by his Spirit, which is powred forth upon his sons and daughters: praises to the Lord for ever.

    _ To the Heads of this Nation, and all the Dominions of the Earth, and to all who are under the Dominion of the earthly Powers, Nations and Kingdomes every where in all the world; To you all Kings, Princes, Dukes, Rulers, Judges, Justices, Third-Burrows, or Town-Clerks.

    _ Moved of the Lord from the Spirit of the Lord, which is to you all a visitation who are in the everlasting Covenant, sent from God, to warn you all of woe and misery which is coming upon all injustice and ungodlinesse, and false wayes, therefore haste, haste, to meet the Lord, by putting off the works of darknesse, and none take the title of Justice which are unjust, lest you be found liers before God, which is just, and will plague you: For a day of vengeance and plagues is coming upon the Beast and false Prophet, from him who is just, who will bear the government upon his shoulders, who is righteous and just, glorious and blessed for ever.

    _ Moved of the Lord, which is the Word of the Lord, written from the Spirit of the Lord, a friend of the Common-wealth of Israel, and the freedome of the righteous seed, and establishing righteousnesse.

    _ The voyce of the Lord uttering forth the word of the Lord in the power of the Lord sounding forth to all you who profess Jesus Christ in words but deny him in life and conversation, therefore refuse not him that speaks from heaven; if ye do, ye cannot escape the damnation of hell.
A word of exhortation to you all sonnes and daughters of God, who have obeyed the voyce of God, and 
    _ To all the World.

    _ To the Heads and Rulers of the People.
